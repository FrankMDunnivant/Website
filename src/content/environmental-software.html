<h3>Educational Software Development</h3>
<p><em>All of these software packages have been published since my arrival at Whitman. In general, each package took at least a year to complete, including the selection and discussion of each topic with my peers across the nation, the design/layout, programming, debugging and editing, and production and testing (and more debugging). Peer-review occurred at several stages: (1) in the beginning with topic and concept selection and design, (2) prior to the release of the software package, and (3) by peer acceptance. Given the nature of web page statistics counters, it is impossible to tell how many people used our software, but each year over 10,000 hits from over 105 countries are recorded for our download pages. Internet statistics show that users include government organizations, secondary education, colleges and research universities, and industry.</em></p>

<p><strong>Annual Usage:</strong> Over 10,000 hits from over 105 countries</p>

<h3>Available Software Packages</h3>

<h4>Dispersion Calculator</h4>
<p>This Flask-based and numerical engine package allows users to estimate the dispersion of a chemical tracer or pollutant in soil and sediment columns. Experimental data from pulse or step input of pollutants can be modeled.</p>
<p><strong>Created by:</strong> Gabrielle Boisrame, Albert Schueller, and Frank Dunnivant</p>

</div>
<p>This was our first software package created by Dan Danowski. EnviroLand contains several Visual Basic simulations of wet laboratory experiments for environmental chemistry (alkalinity, hardness, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, etc.), a theoretical calculation/simulator (pC-pH diagram), and seven pollutant fate and transport simulators.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> EnviroLand only works on PC machines.</p>

<h4>Fate-2011</h4>
<p>This upgraded Flask-based package replaces EnviroLand and the original Fate, and is compatible on Mac and PC machines. Fate contains pollutant fate and transport simulators for pulse and step inputs of pollutants to atmospheric, lake, river, and groundwater systems.</p>
