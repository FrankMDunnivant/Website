<h3>Laboratory Equipment and Instrumentation</h3>
<p>The environmental chemistry research laboratory at Whitman College is equipped with modern analytical instrumentation for environmental analysis and research.</p>

<h3>Major Instrumentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GC-MS</strong> - Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry</li>
  <li><strong>ICP-MS</strong> - Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry</li>
  <li><strong>CE System</strong> - Capillary Electrophoresis</li>
  <li><strong>HPLC</strong> - High Performance Liquid Chromatography with UV-Vis and Fluorescence detectors</li>
  <li><strong>AA Spectrometers</strong> - Flame and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometers</li>
  <li><strong>GC-ECD</strong> - Gas Chromatography with Electron Capture Detection</li>
  <li><strong>Ion Chromatograph</strong></li>
  <li><strong>TOC Analyzer</strong> - Total Organic Carbon Analyzer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Trace-level pollutant analysis in aquatic systems</li>
  <li>Isotopic analysis of metals</li>
  <li>Sample preparation and extraction techniques</li>
  <li>Environmental monitoring and assessment</li>
  <li>PCB and pesticide analysis</li>
  <li>Heavy metal determination</li>
  <li>Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instrumentation Funding</h3>
<p>Major instrumentation has been acquired through competitive grants including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust</strong> - $182,500 plus $120,000 matching (GC-MS and CE system)</li>
  <li><strong>Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation</strong> - $50,000 matching for ICP-MS</li>
  <li><strong>Government Surplus</strong> - Over $200,000 in equipment from U.S. EPA and DOE</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instrumentation Acquired through Government Surplus</h3>
<p>During my tenure at Whitman College, the following instruments were acquired through government grants or donations (the only cost to the College for each instrument was shipping):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hewlett Packard 5890 Capillary Column Gas Chromatograph from the U.S. EPA (estimated savings: $40,000)</li>
  <li>Perkin Elmer 3030 Flame and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer from the U.S. Department of Energy (estimated savings: $40,000)</li>
  <li>Perkin Elmer 1100B Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer from the U.S. Department of Energy (estimated savings: $40,000)</li>
  <li>High Performance Liquid Chromatograph with UV-Vis and Fluorescence detectors from the U.S. Department of Energy (estimated savings: $25,000)</li>
  <li>Ion Chromatograph from the City of Walla Walla (estimated savings: $25,000)</li>
  <li>Total Organic Carbon Analyzer from the U.S. Department of Energy (estimated savings: $15,000)</li>
  <li>Environmental Temperature Control Unit from the U.S. Department of Energy (estimated savings: $5,000)</li>
  <li>Numerous broken instruments used in class demonstrations from the U.S. Department of Energy (estimated savings: priceless to students)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shared Instrumentation Center</h3>
<p>In 2004, I pioneered the concept of a shared instrumentation center for the Hall of Sciences, which has been successfully used in grant writing throughout Division III.</p>
